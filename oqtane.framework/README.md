Oqtane is a Modular Application Framework for Blazor

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Foqtane%2Foqtane.framework%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)

![Oqtane](https://github.com/oqtane/framework/blob/master/oqtane.png?raw=true "Oqtane")

Oqtane uses Blazor, an open source and cross-platform web UI framework for building single-page apps using .NET and C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.

Oqtane is being developed based on some fundamental principles which are outlined in the [Oqtane Philosophy](https://www.oqtane.org/Resources/Blog/PostId/538/oqtane-philosophy).

# Getting Started

**Using the latest code:**

- Install **[.NET Core 3.1 SDK (v3.1.300)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/sdk-3.1.300-windows-x64-installer)**.
   
- Install the Preview edition of [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/) (Community, Professional, and Enterprise Editions are all supported) with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload enabled. Oqtane works with all editions of Visual Studio from Community to Enterprise. If you do not have a SQL Server installation available already and you wish to use LocalDB for development, you must also install the **.NET desktop development workload**.  

- Download or Clone the Oqtane source code to your local system. Open the **Oqtane.sln** solution file and Build the solution. 

**Using an official release:**

- A detailed set of instructions for installing Oqtane on IIS is located here: [Installing Oqtane on IIS](https://www.oqtane.org/Resources/Blog/PostId/542/installing-oqtane-on-iis)
- Instructions for upgrading Oqtane are located here: [Upgrading Oqtane](https://www.oqtane.org/Resources/Blog/PostId/543/upgrading-oqtane)

**Additional Instructions**

- If you have already installed a previous version of Oqtane and you wish to do a clean database install, simply reset the DefaultConnection value in the Oqtane.Server\appsettings.json file to "". This will trigger a re-install when you run the application which will execute the database installation scripts.
   
- If you want to submit pull requests make sure you install the [Github Extension For Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.github.com/). It is recommended you ignore any local changes you have made to the appsettings.json file before you submit a pull request. To automate this activity, open a command prompt and navigate to the /Oqtane.Server/ folder and enter the command "git update-index --skip-worktree appsettings.json"

# Background
Oqtane was created by [Shaun Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunbrucewalker/) and is inspired by the DotNetNuke web application framework. Initially created as a proof of concept, Oqtane is a native Blazor application written from the ground up using modern .NET Core technology. It is a modular application framework offering a fully dynamic page compositing model, multi-site support, designer friendly templates (skins), and extensibility via third party modules.
